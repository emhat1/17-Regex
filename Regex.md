# Regex (Regular Expression) Tutorial

Regular expressions (Regex) in coding refer to a short series of characters that can define a search pattern.  It includes accepted characters (and by default, excludes non-accepted characters)

## Summary

The regex to recognise a valid URL looks for both accepted characters and correct formatting.  Ultimately, it identifies whether the provided string is a valid URL.

An example of such a regex is:
````
/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/
````
